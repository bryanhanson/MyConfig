### MyConfig

#### A Simple iOS App to Show Hardware & Software Configuration

`MyConfig` is intended to be a very lean, no frills example of using `Swift` and `autolayout` programatically.  It illustrates a number of basic `Swift` programming techniques.  Finally, it illustrates one more advanced method, namely how to deal with unwrapping optionals in dictionaries.

`MyConfig` was created in `Xcode` beginning by creating a new single view iOS application.  The only custom code is in `ViewController.swift`.
