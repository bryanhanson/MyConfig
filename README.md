### MyConfig

#### A Simple iOS App to Show Hardware & Software Configuration

`MyConfig is a WORK IN PROGRESS`.  The fundamental structures & behavior are changing frequently.

`MyConfig` is intended to be a very lean, no frills example of using `swift` and `autolayout` programatically. It was created in `Xcode` by creating a new single view iOS application.  The only custom code is in `ViewController.swift`.
